Harmonize Project (formerly known as Harmonize Hue) - This project has no affiliation with Philips Hue.

Harmonize is a low latency video analysis and pass-through application built in Python which alters Philips Hue lights based on their location relative to a screen; creating an ambient lighting effect and expanding content past the boundries of a screen.

Currently in development - Expected release in August 2020

Due to litigation with Signify (Owner of the Philips Hue brand), our website was taken down. The homepage for this project is now https://harmonizeproject.matthewpilsbury.com/
